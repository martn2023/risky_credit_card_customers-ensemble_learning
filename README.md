# I. Author's Context
I've held leadership roles in numerous VC-backed tech startups, but:
  - they were all __business__ roles (finance, COO, product)
  - I have no CS degree
  - have never undergone a coding bootcamp
<br>
After building some CRUD web apps and ETL pipelines, I'm upskilling in __Applied ML Engineering__. An ex-Google dev showed me an industry standard book by Aurelien Geron.

# II. What is This?
So far, we've done basic regression models, basic classifiers, and basic decision trees. This project will be about:

- Random Forests
- Combining multiple methods

### Chronology of Topics
Consider that the data scientist/Applied Machine Learning Engineer is a handyman trying to build a house.

- Single model: handyman re-uses a tool (hammer) to hammer nails into a piece of wood
- Voting: handyman uses 3 different tools (hammer, drill, nail gun) producing 3 different outcomes and then takes majority outcome
- Bagging/Random Forest: handyman takes a drill to 100 different wood pieces, but each drill is configured differently, maybe with a different-sized drill bit 
- Boosting: Handyman drills into wood with 1 drill, second handyman fixes mistakes of first handyman, then third handyman fixes mistakes of second handyman and so on
- Stacking- foreman has multiple handyman using the tools in parallel, and after results are in, he learned what combination of handymen and tools to use the next time he encounters nails and wooden boards
