    "# I. Bagging\n",
    "This is a nickanme for ##Bootstrap - Aggregating##, a fancy word for giving different random of the training data to different models (next notebook, we see this in random forest\n",
    "\n",
    "# II. Pasting\n",
    "Similar to above, but key difference is that duplicate use of data points is prohibited. Counter to my initial intuition, this can produce ##inferior## results. By repeatedly using the same data points in ##bagging###, it's easier to isolate variables and quantify difference makers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# III. Boosting\n",
    "Create a sequential chain of models where model A tries something, B learns from A's mistakes, and C learns from B's mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ways to Counter Overfitting\n",
    "- \"Learning Rates\" are how much weigh we give to new models - keep this low\n",
    "- Shallow tree depth - don't let decision trees go beyond 3 layers"
